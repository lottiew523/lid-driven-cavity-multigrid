# 🌀 Lid-Driven Cavity Solver (Vorticity–Streamfunction, MATLAB)

A 2D incompressible flow solver for the classical lid-driven cavity problem using the vorticity–streamfunction formulation.  

This project focuses on **numerical accuracy, convergence behaviour, and solver performance**, including comparison between standard SOR and multigrid acceleration.

---

## 📌 Overview

The solver computes steady-state flow in a square cavity driven by a moving lid.

Key features:
- Finite difference discretisation (2nd order central schemes)
- Explicit time stepping (Euler forward)
- Poisson equation for streamfunction
- Two solvers:
  - Gauss–Seidel SOR
  - Multigrid-accelerated SOR

Includes:
- Parameter sweeps (Re, grid size, relaxation factor)
- Convergence analysis
- Performance benchmarking

## ⚙️ Governing Equations

The solver uses the **vorticity–streamfunction formulation**:

Velocity recovery:
u = dψ/dy  
v = -dψ/dx
